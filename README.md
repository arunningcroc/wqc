Quantized systems interacting with various environments.

Installing requires a C compiler, Cython, maketools and Python 3. Alternatively Cython may be omitted,
and you can then just compile scqo.c yourself. I, however, have absolutely no idea how to do that,
so just use Cython.

Clone the repository. Run "make" and "make test". Run python setup.py. You should now be ready to use the program.

I made this as a project for a course in university; the code was written in a pretty great hurry, and isn't very legible. The .pdf file in "esitys"
folder contains a basic explanation of the concepts involved. Basically, it uses second quantization matrix representation.
